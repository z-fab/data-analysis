This makes the function declaration very flexible since you can pass in basically any number of arguments, named or not, but it makes it difficult to know what is an appropriate argument.

    "Here's where some of the confusion with matplotlib as a library tends to come from. In the last lecture, I explained that there's an Artist layer, and that it is figures with subplots and axes and data points, which are rendered as patches onto these axes, but we haven't seen any of that here. Instead, we just called one function on a module named plot, so what's going on? The pyplot scripting interface is managing a lot of objects for you. It keeps track of the latest figure of subplots, and of the axis objects. Moreover, it actually hides some of these behind methods of its own. So the pyplot module itself has a function which is called plot, but it redirects calls to this function to the current axes object. This makes for a significant learning curve, and you'll see many discussions in web tutorials, and Stack Overflow, where people are confused by these two different approaches to making figures show up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science workflows I think it's much more common to use the scripting layer, like we just did. But it's worth it to take a look at a the alternative object approach that's a bit more verbose. Actually, while some would call it the matplotlib object API, I think it's more accurate to think of it as directly interfacing with the Artist layer instead. "
